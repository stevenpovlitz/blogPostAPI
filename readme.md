# Challenge: Blog API

To close out this lesson, you'll build a CRUD API for a blogging platform.

For this challenge, we'd like you to start (almost) from scratch in order to get more practice bootstrapping new Node/Express applications.

Here are the requirements for this app:

Use npm init to create it afresh.

* It should support the four CRUD operations for a blog posts resource.

* GET and POST requests should go to /blog-posts.

* DELETE and PUT requests should go to /blog-posts/:id.

* Use Express router and modularize routes to /blog-posts.

* Add a couple of blog posts on server load so you'll automatically have some data to look at when the server starts.
